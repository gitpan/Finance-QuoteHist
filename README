Finance-QuoteHist 
-----------------

The Finance-QuoteHist bundle is several modules designed to fetch
historical stock quotes from the web: 
  
Finance::QuoteHist
------------------
Top level aggregator that will select a default lineup of
site instances from which to retrieve quotes. Other
than the default lineup, this module behaves identically
to whichever site-specific module is first in the lineup.
See below for site-specific modules. 

Finance::QuoteHist::Generic
---------------------------
The real workhorse of the bundle, a sub class of
LWP::UserAgent. Site-specific modules are sub classes
of this module.

Finance::QuoteHist::MotleyFool
------------------------------
Specific instance of the Generic module tailored for the
Motley Fool website.

Finance::QuoteHist::FinancialWeb
--------------------------------
Specific instance of the Generic module tailored for the
FinancialWeb site.

INSTALLATION

You install HTML-Element-Extended, as you would install any perl library,
by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DOCUMENTATION

POD style documentation is included with each module. This is normally
converted to a manual page and installed as part of the "make install"
process. You should also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to
extract and read documentation from the module file directly.  See
Changes for recent changes.

DISCLAIMER 

The data returned from these modules is in no way guaranteed, nor
are the developers responsible in any way for how this data (or lack
thereof) is used. The interface is based on URLs and page layouts
that might change at any time. Even though these modules are designed
to be adaptive under these circumstances, they will at some point
probably be unable to retrieve data unless fixed or provided with new
parameters. Furthermore, the data from these web sites is usually not
even guaranteed by the web sites themselves, and oftentimes is
acquired elsewhere. See the documentation for each site-specific
module for more information regarding the disclaimer for that site.
