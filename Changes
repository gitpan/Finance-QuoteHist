Revision history for Perl extension Finance::QuoteHist.

0.22  Sun Oct 29 23:20:11 CST 2000
	- Fixed cache bug with Yahoo::source_type()

0.21  Wed Sep 13 13:25:35 CDT 2000
	- Splits and dividends added
	- Much faster queries, primarily due to taking
	  advantage of Yahoo and CSV-formatted data,
          when available
	- Supports grabbing non-adjusted data, as well
	  as notification when transitioning to a site
	  that cannot provide non-adjusted data
	- Supports auto-adjusting of non-adjusted
	  quotes for tables that include an adjusted
	  column (like Yahoo in HTML mode)
	- Information pedigree support -- i.e., from
	  which site did the quote/split/dividend data
	  come for a particular ticker symbol
	- Revised interface, although the old one is
	  mostly still supported (read the docs!)
	- Defunct ticker symbols still supported
	  (quotes only, no split/dividend)

0.01  Wed Feb  2 18:24:07 CST 2000
